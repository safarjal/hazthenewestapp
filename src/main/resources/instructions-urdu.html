          How do I add data about a single spot?
        </summary>
        <p>
          You can add data about a single spot by putting the date/time the
          spot was seen as both the start time and the end time for that spot.

        <summary>If I want to add a Haiz Aadat that is 5 days, 4 hours
          and 56 minutes long, can I do that in the aadat box?</summary>
        <p>
          Yes. You would write the values separated by :s, 5 days,
          4 hours and 56 minutes would be written as 5:4:56

        <summary>Can I solve a masla about an early miscarriage?</summary>
        <p>
          Yes. First you need to select the Nifas option, and, underneath it,
          uncheck the mustabeen ul khilqa option. Then you must enter the
          starting date of pregnancy, and the date when the miscarriage happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that, enter the start time and end time of bleeding as usual.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that the app needs 2 valid periods before the unusual
          bleeding to solve the masla.

        <summary>Can I solve a masla about Nifas?</summary>
        <p>
          Yes. Please check the nifas box, and the enter the start time and end time of the pregnancy, as well as the
          aadat
          for nifas. If this is a first pregnancy, enter 40 in the nifas aadat. After that, you must enter the start and
          end
          dates of pregnancy. Then you must input the start and end date/time of all bleeding.
          Remember that we usually need 2 information about start and end date/times of 2 correct periods before pregnancy
          to
          solve a nifas masla.

          What are the Haiz Aadat, Tuhr Aadat and Mawjooda Paki boxes for?
        </summary>
        <p>
          Sometimes, instead of a masla with dates and times of previous periods,
          we get information about previous periods in terms of days. For
          example, a woman may ask: My period started on 1st of March, and is
          still continuing on 13th of March. My previous habit was 5 days of
          haiz and 25 days of Tuhr, and this period arrived one day earlier
          than my habit.
          In this case, we will enter 5 in Haiz Aadat, 25 in Tuhr Aadat, and
          24 in Mawjooda Tuhr box, before entering 1st March and 13th March
          as the start and end times of the dam.
